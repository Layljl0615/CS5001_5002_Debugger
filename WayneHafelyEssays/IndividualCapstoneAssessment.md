**Wayne Malcolm Hafely II** Individual Capstone Assessment.

From my academic perspective, my senior design project is about multiple things.
One is about how to apply my ability to learn on learning how a debugger works and how to implement one.
Another is how to apply what I have learned and am learning about user interface design.
Another is how to do research on an existing system and how to figure out its pitfalls and how to improve them.
Another is to apply a technique I recently learned about building the program starting with the user perspective, writing the use code first before the API.

There are several classes that have provided me with tools for tackling this project.
Computer Science-CS1021 and Data Structures CS2028 helped me sharpen my C++ skills and my programming skills in general.
Operating Systems and Systems Programming EECE429, Intro to Computer Systems CS2011, and Malware Analysis CS5138 all taught me about how operating systems work and about assembly language.
I believe classes on operating systems, CPUs, and assembly are going to be the most beneficial to the creation of the debugger itself.
Software Engineering CS5138 is going to help me organize the development of the project.
Finally, User Interface CS5167 (a class I am currently taking), will help me design the debugger's user interface.

My coop experiences have been as a Software Developer at International Techne Group Inc. and Kinetic Vision doing GUI development work.
Both the experiences I learned how to create desktop applications using Qt through Python.
I am not entirely sure yet if we will use Python to create the UI, but the experience will contribute to any framework we might use.
The main skill that I have been trying to develop through ITI and KV is my skills in communicating and working with a team of people.
Communication is going to be very important for this project, especially in the times of remote work, and I hope to apply good communication to my senior design team.

I am excited to participate in this project because I want to learn in-depth details about how debuggers work.
I believe the most popular debuggers right now are heavy to install, leave project files lying around, and are clunky to use, I would like to solve those problems.
I think it would be cool to create my own debugger, and maybe even learn how to contribute to existing debuggers.
I also think it would be very helpful for me to have a debugger that I am very familiar with running on all my machines (being able to run it on multiple operating systems).
It would allow me to write code more efficiently.
Although this is not a direct goal, I think it will be cool to provided other developers with tools/features they would like to have in a debugger.

My main goal with this project is to learn how to create a debugger, not necessarily to create a good one.
I want to take this project in slowly and methodically so I can fully understand the debugger ecosystem.
Going slow will create a better foundation for my future understanding and development of a usable and helpful debugger.
I believe if I go too fast with the development and just try to force out the project it will be like every other random gdb-frontend.
In my opinion, I will have done a good job if I have created a GUI program where I can set a breakpoint on an executing program.
I will start out by researching how a debugger works and attempting to create a debugger. From there I will learn about different debugger features and implement them one at a time.
In parallel with creating these debugger features, I will research other debugger GUI programs and study their UI design, finding what works and does not work and implementing that into this GUI.
