# User Stories

*	As a developer, I want to pause the state of my program and inspect its properties (variables, program stack, inputs, and outputs), so I can figure out what it causing unwanted behavior in my program.
*	As a senior developer, I want easy environment set-ups, so it is quicker and smoother to get started and to get junior developers started.
*	As an optimizer, I want to be able to view and set through the assembly so that I can see what the compiler is doing to my code.
*	As a developer, I would like the debugging environment to be in a GUI interface which has a familiar layout to most users, and compatible with the common Oss including Linux and Windows, so that it is easier to understand and to use.
*	As a developer, I want an application that can debug multiple programming languages, so that I can utilize this software in multiple scenarios.
*	As a developer, I want an application that can incrementally compile code as I write it, so that I am able to see the results of my code and make early modifications as necessary.
*	As a developer, I want an application that is able to identify common runtime coding errors (infinite loops, null pointers, segmentation faults) and useful ways to resolve these errors, so that they can be identified early in the coding process and resolved before testing.
*	As a developer, I want the application to also identify methods, functions, and loops which are inefficient in terms of O(n) and suggest methods of coding them more efficiently, so that code can execute as optimally as possible.
*	As a developer, I want an application that can sort through a list of multiple compilation errors and potentially identify the relevant errors, rather than simply enumerating though every compile error found while attempting to parse the code following the actual error, so that the programmer can more efficiently debug code and identify the source of their issues.
*	As a developer, I want the application to be integrated with a source-control application, such as Github, so that commits can be made from within the application.
*	As a developer, I want the application to run efficiently on a common machine hardware configuration, used in software development (CPU clock speed, memory size, and disk configuration), without utilizing an enormous number of resources, so that this application can be portable to most machines.
*	As a developer, I want to be able to save the current state of my application (files), so that I can resume developing it at a later point in time.
