# Task Lists

**TODO: assign or claim tasks**

### Starting GUI
Research GUI frameworks to decide which one we might want to complete the project with. Each of these should be completed on both **Windows** and **Linux**.

* Create a basic application using Qt
* Create a basic application using PyQt
* Create a basic application using ImGui
* Create a basic application using GTK

## Starting Debugger
Get started in creating the debugger. The earlier we start the better we will understand how everything should be designed.

* Create a debugger application that can attach itself to another program. (Just a basic application. no breakpoints or anything)
