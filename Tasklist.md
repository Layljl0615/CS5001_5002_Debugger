# Task Lists
**TODO: assign or claim tasks**

These lists are not complete by any means. Some tasks may become unnecessary, and new tasks will be added at any time.

### Starting GUI
Research GUI frameworks to decide which one we might want to complete the project with. Each of these should be completed on both **Windows** and **Linux**.

- [] List programs that use each of the following frameworks. Note the purpose of the application, the operating system, and the look/feel of the program.
    - [] Qt
    - [] PyQt
    - [] ImGui
    - [] GTK
- [] Create a basic application using Qt
- [] Create a basic application using PyQt
- [] Create a basic application using ImGui
- [] Create a basic application using GTK


### Starting Debugger and Debugger Functionality
Get started in creating the debugger. The earlier we start the better we will understand how everything should be designed.

* Windows
    - [x] Create a debugger application that can attach itself to another program. (Just a basic application. no breakpoints or anything) *Wayne*
    - [] Read memory from an attached program
    - [] Write memory from an attached program
    - [] Read CPU registers from an attached program 
    - [] Write CPU registers from an attached program 
    - [] Set and manage breakpoints
    - [] Catch and interpret program exceptions
    - [] Start the debugee program from the debugger
    - [] Read in C++ source for user interaction 

* Linux 
    - [] Create a debugger application that can attach itself to another program. 
    - [] Read memory from an attached program
    - [] Write memory from an attached program
    - [] Read CPU registers from an attached program 
    - [] Write CPU registers from an attached program 
    - [] Set and manage breakpoints
    - [] Catch and interpret program exceptions
    - [] Start the debugee program from the debugger
    - [] Read in C++ source for user interaction
