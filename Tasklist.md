# Task Lists
**TODO: assign or claim tasks**

These lists are not complete by any means. Some tasks may become unnecessary, and new tasks will be added at any time.

### Starting GUI
Research GUI frameworks to decide which one we might want to complete the project with. Each of these should be completed on both **Windows** and **Linux**.

- [ ] Create a list programs that use each of the following frameworks. Note the purpose of the application, the operating system, and the look/feel of the program. *Deion*
    - [ ] Qt - *Deion*
    - [ ] PyQt *Deion*
    - [ ] ImGui *Deion*
    - [ ] GTK *Deion*
- [ ] Create a basic application using Qt - *Deion*
- [ ] Create a basic application using PyQt - *Deion*
- [ ] Create a basic application using ImGui - *Deion*
- [ ] Create a basic application using GTK - *Deion*

### GUI Features
Here are some things we might want in the final UI (using whatever framework)
- [ ] Implement a text viewer - *Deion*
- [ ] Develop a set breakpoint system - *Deion*
- [ ] Develop a breakpoint viewer system - *Deion*
- [ ] Develop a visual indication of the program hitting a breakpoint - *Deion*
- [ ] Implement a memory viewer/editor - *Deion*
    - [ ] allow the user to view/edit the values in different bases - *Deion*
- [ ] Implement a CPU register viewer/editor - *Deion*
    - [ ] allow the user to view/edit the values in different bases - *Deion*
- [ ] Develop an option to view assembly alongside source code - *Deion*
- [ ] Develop a syntax highlighting system (RegEx?) - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement for x86 Assembly  - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement for C  - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement for C++ - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement for other languages (add to this list) ... - *Wayne*
- [ ] Implement a system to select an .exe to debug - *Deion*
- [ ] Implement a system to select a running process to debug  - *Deion*
- [ ] Develop interactive buttons for debugger interactions - *Deion*
    - [ ] Continue  - *Deion*
    - [ ] Step-forward - *Deion*
    - [ ] Stop - *Deion*

### Starting Debugger and Debugger Functionality
Get started in creating the debugger. The earlier we start the better we will understand how everything should be designed.

* Windows
    - [x] Create a debugger application that can attach itself to another program. (Just a basic application. no breakpoints or anything) - *Wayne* 
    - [ ] Implement: Read memory from an attached program - *James*
    - [ ] Implement: Write memory from an attached program - *James*
    - [ ] Implement: Read CPU registers from an attached program - *James*
    - [ ] Implement: Write CPU registers from an attached program - *James*
    - [ ] Implement: Set and manage breakpoints - *James*
    - [ ] Implement: Catch and interpret program exceptions - *James*
    - [ ] Implement: Start the debugee program from the debugger - *James*
    - [ ] Implement: Read in C++ source for user interaction - *James*

* Linux 
    - [ ] Create a debugger application that can attach itself to another program. *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Read memory from an attached program - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Write memory from an attached program - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Read CPU registers from an attached program  - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Write CPU registers from an attached program  - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Set and manage breakpoints - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Catch and interpret program exceptions - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Start the debugee program from the debugger - *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Read in C++ source for user interaction - *Wayne*
