# Task Lists
**TODO: assign or claim tasks**

These lists are not complete by any means. Some tasks may become unnecessary, and new tasks will be added at any time.

### Starting GUI
Research GUI frameworks to decide which one we might want to complete the project with. Each of these should be completed on both **Windows** and **Linux**.

- [ ] Create a list programs that use each of the following frameworks. Note the purpose of the application, the operating system, and the look/feel of the program.
    - [ ] Qt
    - [ ] PyQt
    - [ ] ImGui
    - [ ] GTK
- [ ] Create a basic application using Qt
- [ ] Create a basic application using PyQt
- [ ] Create a basic application using ImGui
- [ ] Create a basic application using GTK  *James*

#### GUI Features
Here are some things we might want in the final UI (using whatever framework)
- [ ] Implement a text viewer *James*
- [ ] Develop a set breakpoint system
- [ ] Develop a breakpoint viewer system *James*
- [ ] Develop a visual indication of the program hitting a breakpoint *James*
- [ ] Implement a memory viewer/editor
    - [ ] allow the user to view/edit the values in different bases
- [ ] Implement a CPU register viewer/editor
    - [ ] allow the user to view/edit the values in different bases
- [ ] Develop an option to view assembly alongside source code
- [ ] Develop a syntax highlighting system (RegEx?)
    - [ ] Implement for x86 Assembly 
    - [ ] Implement for C 
    - [ ] Implement for C++ *James*
    - [ ] Implement for other languages (add to this list) ...
- [ ] Implement a system to select an .exe to debug
- [ ] Implement a system to select a running process to debug 
- [ ] Develop interactive buttons for debugger interactions
    - [ ] Continue 
    - [ ] Step-forward
    - [ ] Stop

### Starting Debugger and Debugger Functionality
Get started in creating the debugger. The earlier we start the better we will understand how everything should be designed.

* Windows
    - [x] Create a debugger application that can attach itself to another program. (Just a basic application. no breakpoints or anything) *Wayne*
    - [ ] Implement: Read memory from an attached program
    - [ ] Implement: Write memory from an attached program
    - [ ] Implement: Read CPU registers from an attached program 
    - [ ] Implement: Write CPU registers from an attached program 
    - [ ] Implement: Set and manage breakpoints
    - [ ] Implement: Catch and interpret program exceptions
    - [ ] Implement: Start the debugee program from the debugger
    - [ ] Implement: Read in C++ source for user interaction 

* Linux 
    - [ ] Create a debugger application that can attach itself to another program. 
    - [ ] Implement: Read memory from an attached program
    - [ ] Implement: Write memory from an attached program
    - [ ] Implement: Read CPU registers from an attached program 
    - [ ] Implement: Write CPU registers from an attached program 
    - [ ] Implement: Set and manage breakpoints
    - [ ] Implement: Catch and interpret program exceptions
    - [ ] Implement: Start the debugee program from the debugger
    - [ ] Implement: Read in C++ source for user interaction
