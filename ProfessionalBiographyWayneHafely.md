Hello!

I have a couple different ideas for a capstone project. If you are
interesting in any of them, or have a similar idea, please contact me!

# Project Sought

I have a couple different capstone projects in mind.

1. A standalone debugger with the goal of being easy to use, portable,
and easy to port to other operating systems.
    * I would want to create the backend and the frontend of the software instead
    just creating a GUI on top of gdb or other existing debuggers
    * In the end, both the backend and frontend should be easy to use (priority on the frontend)
    * Goal would be to work on any compiled language

2. A 2D puzzle-style video game that explores non-euclidean spaces
    * Similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8),
    but in 2D.
    * I do want to build this from scratch (no game engine)
    * The goal is to have the user explore non-euclidean spaces.
    * I do not have a specific idea for kind of puzzles to use to motivate the player to explore

3. An OBS "filter"/"overlay" for obfuscating Leauge of Legends mini-map data.
    * LoL has a minimap that many streamers hide to thwart "stream-snipers"
    * I want to make a fake minimap that trys to trick the stream-snipers to make bad decisions
    * This project would deal with OBS and image-processing techniques
